floor :: Float -> Integer
floor = read . (takeWhile (/= '.') . show

Float -> [Char] -> Integer

Doesn't work because...

- float may not necessarily contain a dot ?
- `show` can take any type ?
- a type was not specified to `read` in the function definition ?
- doesn't work for exponent notation ?
